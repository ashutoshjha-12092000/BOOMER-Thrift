BOOMER - Thrift store demo (static)
Files:
 - index.html   -> Main single-page app
 - styles.css   -> Styles
 - script.js    -> Simple demo JS (no backend)
How to run:
 - Unzip and open index.html in a browser (works locally).
 - For deployment: push to GitHub and enable GitHub Pages, or deploy on Netlify/Vercel as a static site.
Next steps to make real:
 1) Add backend (listings, user auth) - Node/Express + DB or Firebase.
 2) Payment integration (Razorpay / Stripe).
 3) Seller onboarding & verification UI + admin panel.
 4) Delivery & logistics: local courier partners, pickup scheduling, commission payouts.
 5) Quality checks & return policy.
 6) Analytics, search, filters, category pages.
Notes about your model:
 - Your plan to not hold inventory and take commission is good for low capital. Ensure clear trust signals (seller ratings, photos, return window).
 - Style number is a unique SKU-like identifier for each listing (helps search & returns).
